 Starwars themed Evuite.
 
So, once again I was underwhelmed by my options for digital invitations.  While hosting a movie night for the school, I decided to make my own to honor the great Star Wars movie. 

The invitation has several bells and whistles including a generated starfield effect and the iconic scrolling marquee.

This was made in the days before stringent browser controls, so you have to enable autoplay to get the full effect of the booming theme song.
